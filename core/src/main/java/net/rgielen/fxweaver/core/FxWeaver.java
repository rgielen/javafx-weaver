/**
 * FxWeaver is the core weaving facility, enabling Controllers and Views to be instantiated by a dependency injection
 * framework such as (but not limited to) Spring.

 * The following example requires a Spring ConfigurableApplicationContext to be instantiated. If now MainController is
 * declared as Spring managed bean, it will get created and injected by Spring.
 * <p>
 * If a managed Controller class contains an {@link FxmlView} annotation, attached FXML views are injected as well.
